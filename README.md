# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether a person has heart disease using machine learning.

## Algorithms Used
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine

## Steps Followed
1. Data loading and preprocessing
2. Feature scaling
3. Train-test split
4. Model training
5. Model comparison using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

## Result
Decision Tree and Random Forest showed similar performance due to simplicity of dataset.

## Tools Used
